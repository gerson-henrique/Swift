A collection of smooth animations to use within your page.

Usage
Add one of the .uk-animation-* classes to any element. The animation is shown when the class is added, so usually immediately on page load. To show the animation at another point, for example when the element enters the viewport, you would add the class using JavaScript â€” with the Scrollspy component for instance. This is what happens in many of UIkit's components that make use of animations. All animations themselves are implemented with CSS, so they do not require JavaScript to play.

CLASS	DESCRIPTION
.uk-animation-fade	The element fades in.
.uk-animation-scale-up
.uk-animation-scale-down	The element fades in and scales up or down.
.uk-animation-slide-top
.uk-animation-slide-bottom .uk-animation-slide-left
.uk-animation-slide-right	The element fades and slides in from the top, bottom, left or right by its own height or width.
.uk-animation-slide-top-small
.uk-animation-slide-bottom-small .uk-animation-slide-left-small
.uk-animation-slide-right-small	The element fades and slides in from the top, bottom, left or right with a smaller distance which is specified by a fixed pixel value.
.uk-animation-slide-top-medium
.uk-animation-slide-bottom-medium .uk-animation-slide-left-medium
.uk-animation-slide-right-medium	The element fades and slides in from the top, bottom, left or right with a medium distance which is specified by a fixed pixel value.
.uk-animation-kenburns	The element scales very slowly up without fading in.
.uk-animation-shake	The element shakes.
.uk-animation-stroke	The SVG element strokes are drawn.
To toggle an animation on hover or focus, add the .uk-animation-toggle class to a parent element. Also add tabindex="0" to make the animation focusable through keyboard navigation and on touch devices.

<div class="uk-animation-toggle" tabindex="0">
    <div class="uk-animation-fade"></div>
</div>


or reverse

<div class="uk-animation-fade uk-animation-reverse"></div>

Ken Burns
To add a simple Ken Burns effect, add the .uk-animation-kenburns class to any image. You can also apply the .uk-animation-reverse or one of the .uk-transform-origin-* classes from the Utility component to modify the effect.

<img class="uk-animation-kenburns" src="" width="" height="" alt="">
By default, the animation starts on page load. In this example we used the Scrollspy component, to toggle the effect when the image enters the view.

SVG Strokes
The Animation component can be used to animate SVG strokes. The effect looks like the SVG strokes are drawn before your eyes. The SVG image has to be injected into the markup as an inline SVG. This can be done manually or using the SVG component.

The following example shows how to add the inline SVG manually. Since you have to know the exact length of the stroke, UIkit requires you to set the length in the custom property --uk-animation-stroke. In this example the stroke length is 46.

<svg class="uk-animation-stroke" style="--uk-animation-stroke: 46;" viewBox="0 0 20 20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <path fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="1" d=""/>
</svg>
A much easier way is to use the SVG component by adding uk-svg="stroke-animation: true" to the image element. It will calculate the stroke length and add the --uk-animation-stroke custom property automatically.

<img src="" width="" height="" alt="" uk-svg="stroke-animation: true">
